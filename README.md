# Global_Terrorism_Analysis
Almabetter capstone project.

Project Summary :-

In this EDA project, we were provided with the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) which is a database including information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2017. Unlike many other event databases, the GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 181,000 cases.
In this project we are doing the exploratory data analysis on the global terrorisam database to find out various insights of terrorism activity and their effect over region,country and city. Also we did some visualizations for easy understandings of the analysis.
After analyzing the cleaned data, we divided the project into various types of analysis. The first is the analysis based on Trend of Terrorrism Per Year the second is the analysis based on Most affected areas of Terrorism. Third analysis based on Terrorist Organization and the last analysis is based on country.
In the EDA we have conclude that after 2011 there is a large growth recorded in terrorist activity and 2014 appears to be a witness of huge terrorist attack.
